\section{Introduction}
Energy functions are used to model protein 3D structures. Aspects that influence the free energy of proteins are van-der-Waals forces, electrostatics, dipole interactions, and torsions. \citet{Zhang1997} described a method to approximate the solvation energy based on atom contacts, rather than residue interactions, as proposed by \citet{Miyazawa1996}.

Their approach is to assign one of 18 atom types to each heavy atom. Based on these types, the energetic contribution of each contact pair to the overall energy is derived. A contact pair is defined by \citet{Zhang1997} as two atoms that have a distance below 6\,\AA\ and that are at least ten covalent bonds away from each other. The covalent distance is approximated with respect to connectivity classes without considering bonds in side-chains.

Here, we implement this algorithm and assess its quality on various protein prediction data sets.

\section{Material and Methods}
We implemented the algorithm in the Python language. In addition, we used Biopython's pdb processing functionality \citep{pdb}.

The pairwise contact energies were adopted from \citet{Zhang1997}. We used the auhor's cutoff distance of 6\,\AA, because we were able to verify this value based on the atomic packaging of a large set of non-homologous experimental protein structures.

The quality of the implemented function was assessed on a subset of the submissions to the eleventh CASP competition (Critical Assessment of protein Structure Prediction) \fnurl{http://www.predictioncenter.org/casp11}{\today}. The datasets in question were T0762, T0769, T0776, T0784. We evaluated each prediction by superimposing its backbone C$\alpha$ atoms onto the reference and computing the RMSD, which we compared to the RMSD values listed on the CASP website \fnurl{TODO}{\today}.
Afterwards, we investigated correlations between the RMSD and the computed energies. The python package SciPy \citep{scipy} was used for the computation of the Pearson and the Spearman correlation coefficients.

\section{Results}
For every target structure we visualized the prediction with the lowest RMSD and the one with the lowest free contact energy in BALLView \citep{ballview}. Example visualizations of datasets T0679 and T0784 are shown in Fig. \ref{fig:visualize}

The relationship between ranked contact energy prediction and the RMSD are shown in Fig. \ref{ranks}.

	\label{ranks}
\end{figure}

Pearson's correlation coefficients between our free contact energies and the energies calculated by the CASP experiment ranged from 0.19 to 0.44. When comparing our energies to the corresponding ranks from CASP, the Spearman's correlation coefficients ranged from 0.15 to 0.33 (Table \ref{tbl:comparison}). We also manually compared our RSMD calculations with those from CASP and found that they largely correspond well to one another.

\section{Discussion}
As shown by Fig. \ref{ranks}, RMSD values change little for the predictions which scored highest in the original CASP11 experiment. Together with the fact that the prediction with lowest energy in no case possesed the lowest RMSD as well, this suggests that the RMSD measure is a rather poor assessment for prediction quality on its own. Further it seems that the best scoring predictions are not far away from each other in most cases.\\
