    \begin{itemize}[<+->]
        \item Trends of structural correspondence (except for \texttt{T0769})
        \item Linear Correlation measures of energy and RMSD fail\\
        $\Rightarrow$ RMSD almost the same for first 2/3 of predictions
        \item RMSD measure not reliable\\
        $\Rightarrow$ CASP uses multiple measures
        \item Function by \cite{Zhang1997} is fast! (only sums)
        \item But: $10$ years old
    \end{itemize}

% Similarities of Diagrams
% Problems of Correlation
% Problem of RMSD, CASP has many
% Function is fast
% Outperformed aka outdated
